## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Required Tables

#### course_enrollments

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)

- learner_id (UUID, Foreign Key → learners.id)
- enrolled_at (TIMESTAMP)
- status (TEXT)
```

#### courses

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- instructor_id (UUID, Foreign Key → instructors.id)
- title (TEXT)
- price (DECIMAL)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

#### withdrawals

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- instructor_id (UUID, Foreign Key → instructors.id)
- amount (DECIMAL)
- status (TEXT) -- 'PENDING', 'COMPLETED', 'FAILED', 'CANCELLED'
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- processed_at (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
- notes (TEXT, nullable)
```

## 🔧 Repository Methods

### RevenueDataRepository

#### Core Revenue Methods

- `getInstructorRevenue(instructorId)` - Complete revenue calculation
- `getRevenueForPeriod(instructorId, startDate, endDate)` - Custom period revenue
- `getTopPerformingCourses(instructorId, limit)` - Best performing courses

#### Withdrawal Methods

- `createWithdrawalRequest(instructorId, amount, notes)` - Submit new withdrawal
- `cancelWithdrawalRequest(withdrawalId)` - Cancel pending withdrawal
- `getTransactionHistory(instructorId, page, limit)` - Paginated history
- `getPendingWithdrawals(instructorId)` - Active withdrawal requests

#### Statistics Methods

- `_getRevenueStatistics(instructorId)` - Multi-period statistics
- `_getCourseRevenues(instructorId)` - Per-course breakdown
- `_getWeeklyTrend(instructorId)` - 12-week trend data

## 🔄 Provider State Management

### RevenueProvider

#### State Properties

- `instructorRevenue` - Current revenue data
- `transactionHistory` - Withdrawal history
- `isLoading` / `isLoadingTransactions` / `isSubmittingWithdrawal` - Loading states
- `error` - Error message handling

#### Core Methods

- `loadInstructorRevenue(instructorId)` - Load complete revenue data
- `loadTransactionHistory(instructorId, page, limit)` - Load withdrawal history
- `submitWithdrawalRequest(instructorId, amount, notes)` - Submit withdrawal
- `refreshRevenueData(instructorId)` - Refresh all data
- `clearData()` - Clear state on logout

#### Computed Getters

- `totalEarned` / `totalWithdrawn` / `availableBalance` - Quick access
- `courseRevenues` / `weeklyTrend` / `statistics` - Data access
- `getPendingWithdrawals()` / `getCompletedWithdrawals()` - Filtered lists

## 🎨 UI Implementation

### InstructorRevenuePage

Complete revenue dashboard with three tabs:

#### Overview Tab

- Revenue summary cards (earned, withdrawn, available)
- Period-based statistics display
- Weekly revenue trend chart
- Real-time data with Provider

#### Courses Tab

- List of instructor courses
- Revenue per course display
- Enrollment count and last enrollment date
- Revenue sorting (highest to lowest)

#### Transactions Tab

- Withdrawal history with pagination
- Status-based color coding
- Cancel pending withdrawals
- Transaction details and timestamps

#### Withdrawal Dialog

- Available balance display
- Optional notes field
- Real-time submission status

## 💰 Business Logic

### Revenue Calculation

```dart
Total Earned = Sum of (Course Price × Enrollment Count) for all courses
Available Balance = Total Earned - Total Withdrawn
Weekly Revenue = Enrollments in current week × Course Prices
Monthly Revenue = Enrollments in current month × Course Prices
Yearly Revenue = Enrollments in current year × Course Prices
```

### Withdrawal Validation

- Minimum withdrawal amount: $10.00
- Cannot exceed available balance
- Only PENDING withdrawals can be cancelled
- Automatic balance refresh after successful withdrawal

### Status Management

- **PENDING** - Newly submitted, awaiting processing
- **COMPLETED** - Successfully processed and paid
- **FAILED** - Processing failed, funds remain available
- **CANCELLED** - Cancelled by instructor, funds remain available

## 🚀 Integration Guide

### 1. Provider Registration

```dart
// In main.dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    // ... other providers
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => RevenueProvider()),
  ],
  child: MyApp(),
)
```

### 2. Navigation Integration

```dart
// Navigate to revenue page
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => InstructorRevenuePage(
      instructorId: currentInstructorId,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### 3. Data Loading

```dart
// In instructor dashboard
Provider.of<RevenueProvider>(context, listen: false)
    .loadInstructorRevenue(instructorId);
```
