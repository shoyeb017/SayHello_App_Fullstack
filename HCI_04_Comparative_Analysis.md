# 4. Comparative Analysis (HE vs CW)

## 4.1 Overlap

- Both methods identified gaps in feedback/progress cues (send, post, enroll).
- Need for explanatory micro‑copy (matching model) appears in HE and was reinforced by CW confusion during partner search.

## 4.2 Differences

- HE: breadth; surfaced global consistency and terminology issues (icons, empty/ error states, naming) and information hierarchy clarity.
- CW: depth; exposed step‑level discoverability and sequencing issues within critical flows (filters, post routing, post‑enroll CTA).

## 4.3 Quantified snapshot (current sample)

- Total items: 13 (HE≈10, CW≈3). High severity (≥3): 3; Medium (2): 6; Low (1): 1.
- HE contributed more medium/low polish items; CW contributed high‑impact blockers in new‑user journeys.

## 4.4 Risk and impact

- Feedback‑visibility issues cut across multiple flows and impair user trust and efficiency.
- Discoverability issues (filters, post‑enroll CTA) increase time‑to‑task and abandonment risk.

## 4.5 Combined value

- HE ensures principle conformance and consistency; CW validates practical learnability and path clarity.
- Using both yields a pragmatic roadmap: fix global patterns (feedback, icons, terminology) and unblock task flows (filters, post confirmation, enroll routing).
